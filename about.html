        <h2>The Perfect Restart</h2>
        <p>I'm Terry Martin and I'd like to thank you for taking the time to visit my site. 
           After twenty-odd years of being out of work and trying other things, I've decided to restart my career in coding. 
           I can now say categorically it's the thing I love doing the most.</p>

        <h2>Past Experiences</h2>

        <p>
          I spent a few years working in the city of London, using Visual Basic, C# and SQL Server. 
           I still know the ropes and I could pick up any of these quickly. 
           I have 3 MCAD certifications in C# and .net 2.0.
        </p>

        <h2>Present Transferable Skills</h2>
        <p>
          
          To be a web devloper, you need analytical abilities and creativity in equal measure.  My 
          marketing qualifications proove I have the former, and my published novel the latter.
                    
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Talk Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          I've learnt that digital marketing and web development are closely linked. 
           Not only can I build beautiful websites (although I say so myself!), but I can also optimise them for SEO and implement some marketing psychology.
           I have strong copywriting skills, although I don't want to do this unless it's to help the team.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
          I've now added HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python to my repertoire, giving me the complete set 
          of skills needed to recommence my career in I.T.  I'm looking to get a foot in the door with
          a company that offers opportunity for rapid promotion; a company that values their staff
          and welcomes new opinions; a company that can apreciate everything I have to offer.
